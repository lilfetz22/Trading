4. When to exit? 
    a. Vu's strategy (one renko brick in same direction, take half, set SL to 0, then exit on Renko bar reversal)
    b. one renko brick in same direction, take half, set SL to 0, then exit at n fib levels above entry (optimize n)

2. Max daily drawdown
3. Losses in a row


Next Steps:
1. See if I can connect to MetaTrader 4 and run this strategy on a demo account
2. If that doesn't work, then see if I can translate this strategy to create a Expert Advisor in MetaTrader 5
